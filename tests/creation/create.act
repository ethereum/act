// a modest example specifying the creation of a new contract,

// Speciying the creation of a contract serves multiple purposes:
// from a formal semantics perspective, it defines the base case
// for the inductive system that is a smart contract. From a syntactic
// perspective, it defines the storage layout of the contract, by explicit
// typing of storage variables.
