// The invariant x < 9 is true, but cannot be proved as it is not inductive.

// If we assume that the invariant holds at the start of the call to j, then
// there is an execution path (x == 7) where the invariant does not hold over
// the post state.

// A stronger invariant (e.g. x < 3) can succesfully be proven
