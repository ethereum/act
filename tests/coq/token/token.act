constructor of Token
interface constructor (address a, uint256 amt)

creates
  mapping(address => uint256) balances := [a := amt]


behaviour transfer of Token
interface transfer(address to, uint256 amt)


iff in range uint256
  
  balances[to] + amt

iff

  amt <= balances[CALLER]

case CALLER =/= to:

  storage

	balances[CALLER] => balances[CALLER] - amt
	balances[to] => balances[to] + amt

  returns 1


case CALLER == to:

  returns 1
